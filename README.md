## 1. Display Variables
This program demonstrates how to declare and display the values of two variables, an integer (`a`) and a float (`b`).

---

## 2. Global and Local Variables
This program demonstrates the difference between global and local variables by displaying the values of a global variable (`guar`) and a local variable (`luar`).

## 3. Input and Display Numbers
This program takes two integer inputs from the user and displays their values.

---

## 4. Input and Display Date of Birth
This program takes the user's date of birth in the format `dd-mm-yyyy` and displays it.

---

## 5. Using Global Variables and Functions
This program demonstrates the use of a global variable (`guar`) and calls a function (`first`) to display values.

## How to Download and Run

Follow these steps to download and run the programs on your computer or laptop:

### **Step 1: Download the Repository**
1. Visit the GitHub repository page: [C Projects Repository](https://github.com/danish-farhan07/c-programs/).
2. Click on the green **Code** button.
3. Choose one of the following options:
  - **Clone via HTTPS:** Copy the link and run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C-Small-Projects.git
     ```
   - **Download ZIP:** Select **Download ZIP**, extract it to your desired folder.

### **Step 2: Set Up Your Environment**
Ensure you have a C compiler and a code editor installed. Here are some options:

#### **Code Editors**:
- **Turbo C++**: An older IDE for C/C++ programming.  
  - Download: [Turbo C++](https://www.turboc.net/)
  - Note: Some newer systems may not support Turbo C++ natively.
  
- **Dev-C++**: A lightweight, beginner-friendly IDE.  
  - Download: [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A modern editor with extensions for C programming.  
  - Download: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Requires GCC or MinGW as the compiler.

#### **C Compilers**:
- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection): A widely-used open-source compiler.  
  - Install on Linux: `sudo apt install gcc`
  - Install on macOS: Use `brew install gcc` (requires Homebrew)
  - Install on Windows: Use [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) or enable WSL.
